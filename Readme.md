# Rust implementation of Vector-Selection Reinforcement ABC 

This is a re-implementation of my Master's Degree final Year Project in Rust. 

ABC stands for 'Artificial Bee Colony', a search/optimization algorithm first proposed by Karaboga et al. It is a generalized optimization algorithm that allows us to find the best set of parameters for an optimization problem.

The only thing that is necessary is to have a fitness function that outputs datatype f64. This algorithm can search for the best value of your fitness function (it can be an optimization problem or a training model) without any prior knowledge apart from the boundary values of each parameter or dimension.
