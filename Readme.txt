Rust implementation of a variant of the Artificial Bee Colony (Karaboga  et al.) search/optimization algorithm. 

The only thing that is necessary is to have a fitness function that outputs f64. This algorithm can search for the best value of your fitness function (it can be an optimization problem or a training model) without any prior knowledge apart from the boundary values of each parameter or dimension.
